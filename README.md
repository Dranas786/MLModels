# MLModels
Repository for 2 basic ML models
1) MNIST Dataset (Using an already built model, trying to show it's accuracy using a python program which also lets the user draw)
2) Training 5 different models on a small medical dataset to test the accuracies for all of them and how layering etc. affects the results

Technology Stack: Tensorflow, Python
